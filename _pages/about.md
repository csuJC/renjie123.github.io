👋 Welcome to my personal academic website! I am Renjie Gu, from Jiangyin City, Jiangsu Province, currently an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at Central South University, passionate about the application of computer technology! What's more, I'm interested in **trustworthy AI,T2I and LLM/MLLM**.I am currently working as a research assistant at the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, collaborating with [Prof. Yiming Li](https://liyiming.tech/) and [Boheng Li](https://antigonerandy.github.io/). 🔥

Education & Experience 🎓
======
**Central South University, Changsha, China**  
*Undergraduate student in Computer Science and Technology*  
*GPA: 90.87/100 (3.92/4.0)*  
*09/2022 - Present*

**Nanyang Technological University, Singapore**
*Research Assistant,12/2024 - Present*
My time here is spent studing building resilient unlearning for diffusion models.I'm also interested in other AI safety topics and general mllm and diffusion model for image generation.

**SYNC (Beijing, China)(AI Startup)**  
*LLM and iOS Development Intern,07/2024 - 09/2024*  
I focus on optimizing specific chat scenarios using LLM agents. My work also included enhancing the humor and empathy of LLMs by fine-tuning models.

Publications & Research 🧠
======
- [**Unlearners Can Lie: Evaluating and improving “Honesty” in LLM Unlearning**](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=fhrOSzieCS), First contribution
  **ACL 2026 on submission & NeurIPS 2025 Lock-LLM Workshop accepted**
  *We define and evaluate the honesty of LLM unlearning, which is a important yet neglected problem in LLM unlearning*
- [**Towards Resilient Safety-driven Unlearning for Diffusion Models against Downstream Fine-tuning**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16302), second contribution, co-authored with Boheng Li
  **NeurIPS 2025 poster**
  *We develop ResAligh, an effiecnt and effective algorithm to erase concepts from T2I diffusion models, making them resilient to the downstream fintunings*
- [**MHALO: Evaluating MLLMs as Fine-grained Hallucination Detectors**](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=t1W8txNm7K), Equal first contribution, co-authored with Yishuo Cai
  **ACL 2025 Findings**
  *We developed a fine-grained hallucination benchmark for a multimodal large language model as a judge. We also tried some methods to improve their ability as a judger and get some insights*
- [**Course-Correction: Safety Alignment Using Synthetic Preferences**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16637), co-authored with Rongwu xu,Yishuo Cai 
  **EMNLP 2024**  
  This research provides in-depth insights into AI safety and model alignment, highlighting the concept of course-correction and proposing the C-Syn benchmark and methods for course-correction LLM fine-tuning. I was mainly responsible for the experimental part of the team, including dataset synthesis and model performance testing.

- During my internship, I conducted in-depth research on the performance of AI agents and LLMs in practical applications, especially on how to enhance the empathy and humor of LLMs and optimize model performance through synthetic data generation.
