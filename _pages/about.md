👋 Welcome to my personal academic website! I am Renjie Gu, from Jiangyin City, Jiangsu Province, currently an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology, passionate about the application of computer technology and LLM! 🔥 

Education & Experience 🎓
======
**Central South University, Changsha, China**  
*Undergraduate student in Computer Science and Technology*  
*GPA: 90.87/100 (3.92/4.0)*  
*09/2022 - Present*

**SYNC (Beijing, China)**  
*LLM and iOS Development Intern*  
*07/2024 - 08/2024*  
During my internship at this AI-focused startup, I was mainly responsible for iOS application development and optimizing specific chat scenarios using LLM agents. My work also included enhancing the humor and empathy of LLMs by fine-tuning models and generating synthetic data to improve model performance.

Publications & Research 🧠
======
- **Course-Correction: Safety Alignment Using Synthetic Preferences**, co-authored with Xu R, Cai Y, Zhou Z, Gu R  
  *Published in arXiv:2407.16637, 2024*  
  *EMNLP 2024 Industry Track*  
  This research provides in-depth insights into AI safety and model alignment, highlighting the concept of course-correction and proposing the C-Syn benchmark and methods for course-correction LLM fine-tuning. I was mainly responsible for the experimental part of the team, including dataset synthesis and model performance testing.

- During my internship, I conducted in-depth research on the performance of AI agents and LLMs in practical applications, especially on how to enhance the empathy and humor of LLMs and optimize model performance through synthetic data generation.

- I am currently collaborating with Feijiang Han from Upenn to explore the role of cognitive levels in reasoning within LLMs.
