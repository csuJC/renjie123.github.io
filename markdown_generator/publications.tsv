2024-10-02	Course-Correction: Safety Alignment Using Synthetic Preferences	EMNLP 2024 Industry Track	The risk of harmful contents generated by large language models (LLMs) becomes a critical concern. This paper systematically evaluates and enhances LLMs' capability to perform \emph{course-correction}, \ie, the model can steer away from generating harmful content autonomously. First, we introduce the C-Eval benchmark for quantitative assessment and analyze 10 popular LLMs, revealing varying proficiency of current safety-tuned LLMs in course-correction. To improve, we propose fine-tuning LLMs with preference learning, emphasizing the preference for timely course-correction. Using an automated pipeline, we create C-Syn, a synthetic C-Syn with 750K pairwise preferences, to teach models the concept of timely course-correction through data-driven learning. Experiments on \textsc{Llama2-Chat 7B} and \textsc{Qwen2 7B} show that our method effectively enhances course-correction skills without affecting general performance. Additionally, it effectively improves LLMs' safety, particularly in resisting jailbreak attacks.	Xu, R., Cai, Y., Zhou, Z., Gu, R., Weng, H., Liu, Y., ... & Qiu, H. (2024).
